            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Lumpia is another classic staple of the Philippines and is also
                recognized as a popular Filipino dish that many foreignors may 
                already feel familiar with.</p>
            <p>Similar to an egg roll, it is a fried spring roll traditionally
                made with a thin pastry skin (a.k.a lumpia wrapper). Upon taking
                your first bite, you'll be met with a savory mix of either chicken
                or ground pork and vegetables.</p>
            <p>Lumpia can be enjoyed as it is, however it's best paired with either
                a sweet and sour sauce or vinegar sauce!</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the tablespoon of oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat then add pork</li>
                <li>Cook the pork until crumbly with no signs of pink (approximately 5-8 minutes), 
                    then remove pork to the side and drain the grease from the pan</li>
                <li>Next, sautee onion and garlic to the pan for about 2 minutes. Once fragrant, add in
                    the pork, along with the carrots, green onions, cabbage, and cilantro.</li>
                <li>Season with pepper, salt, garlic powder, and soy sauce. Then remove from the heat
                    to let it cool.</li>
                <li>Now, assemble the lumpia. Take about 3 heaping tablespoons of filling diagnolly near 
                    one corner of a lumpia wrapper, leaving a 1 1/2 inch of space at both ends.</li>
                <li>Fold the side along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in both ends, and 
                    roll neatly and tightly to close.</li>
                <li>Moisten the other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge. Transfer to a plate
                    and cover with plastic wrap to retain mositure. Repeat for the remaining.</li>
                <li>Now to fry. First, heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat for
                    5 minutes.</li>
                <li>With the seams face down, slide 3 or 4 lumpias into the hot oil.</li>
                <li>While frying for 1-2 minutes, turn occasionally, until all sides are golden brown.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and repeat the process for the remaining
                    lumpia.</li>
                <li>Lastly, serve while hot either by itself or with a well-paired sauce and enjoy!</li>
