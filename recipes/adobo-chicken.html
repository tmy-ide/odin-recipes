            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Adobo Chicken is considered as the national dish of the Philippines
                and arguably one of, if not, the most popularly well-known Filipino dish!</p>
            <p>Chicken Adobo is known to be sweet yet savory (a very common Filipino 
                flavor style!) with notes of heat from the heavy use of garlic and 
                peppercorn.</p>
            <p>Every Filipino household, whether it be in the states or the motherland, 
                has their own varation of how they make the classic and relatively simple
                Adobo Chicken. So while I will be sharing my own style, anyone reading this
                can and should experiment with the recipe to satisfy your own palette (as 
                long as you retain the basic Adobo-esque flavor of course!)
            </p>
            <p>Below is the recipe as follows:</p>

                <li>white vinegar </li>
                <li>onion</li>
                <li>garlic</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Marinate the chicken briefly (at least one hour)</li>
                <li>Once the pan is hot, sear it on the pan</li>
                <li>Remove the chicken from the pan and sautee the garlic and onions</li>
                <li>Now place the chicken back on the pan and let it simmer with the marinade for 25 minutes until the sauce has reduced</li>
                <li>Once the sauce has reduced it should have the consistency of a thick glaze</li>
                <li>Now remove the chicken to plate and take the glaze sauce left on the pan and cover it all over the chicken</li>
                <li>Lastly, serve with rice (preferrably garlic rice!) and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
