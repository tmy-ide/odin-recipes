                <p>Adobo Chicken is considered as the national dish of the Philippines
                    and arguably one of, if not, the most popularly well-known Filipino dish!</p>
                <p>Chicken Adobo is known to be sweet yet savory (a very common Filipino 
                    flavor style!) with notes of heat from the heavy use of garlic and 
                    peppercorn.</p>
                <p>Every Filipino household, whether it be in the states or the motherland, 
                    has their own varation of how they make the classic and relatively simple
                    Adobo Chicken. So while I will be sharing my own style, anyone reading this
                    can and should experiment with the recipe to satisfy your own palette (as 
                    long as you retain the basic Adobo-esque flavor of course!)</p>
                <p>Below is the recipe as follows:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                    <li>soy sauce</li>
                    <li>white vinegar</li>
                    <li>onion</li>
                    <li>garlic</li>
                    <li>peppercorns</li>
                    <li>sugar</li>
                    <li>bay leaves</li>
                    <li>green onion</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class='inline'>
                <ol>
                    <li>Marinate the chicken briefly (at least one hour)</li>
                    <li>Heat the pan to medium high heat and oil to the pan</li>
                    <li>Once the pan is hot, sear the chicken on the pan</li>
                    <li>Remove the chicken from the pan and sautee the garlic 
                        and onions</li>
                    <li>Once garlic and onions are fragrant and soft, place 
                        the chicken back on the pan and let it simmer with the 
                        marinade for 25 minutes until the sauce has reduced</li>
                    <li>Once the sauce has reduced it should have the 
                        consistency of a thick glaze</li>
                    <li>Now remove the chicken to plate and take the glaze 
                        sauce left on the pan and cover it all over the 
                        chicken</li>
                    <li>Lastly, serve with rice (preferrably garlic rice!) 
                        and enjoy!</li>
