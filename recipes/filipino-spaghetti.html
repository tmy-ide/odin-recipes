            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The Filipino Spaghetti is a funky take on the ever classic 
                Italian spaghetti. While traditional spaghetti is tangy and 
                savory, Filipino spaghetti is known to be sweet. This 
                dish is simple and also something that every kid can enjoy!</p>
            <p>Some recipes use sugar as the main sweetener, however, the most
                traditional way to sweeten the sauce is by using Jufran sauce--
                otherwise known as banana ketchip. Gound beef or pork is also
                mixed into the sauce as well as pork sausage and even hotdog. 
                Upon serving, cheddar cheese is springkled right on top!</p>
            <p>Although, technically, not a Filipino dish, its recipe strays
                from the original which exemplifies the countless other
                Filipino dishes that are influenced by other cultures.</p>
