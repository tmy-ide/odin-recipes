            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The Filipino Spaghetti is a funky take on the ever classic 
                Italian spaghetti. While traditional spaghetti is tangy and 
                savory, Filipino spaghetti is known to be sweet and savory 
                (a common flavor palette for many Filipno dishes!). This 
                dish is simple and also something that every kid can enjoy!</p>
            <p>Instead of meatballs, ground beef is traditionally mixed into
                the sauce as well as pork sausage and even hotdog. Upon 
                serving, cheddar cheese is springkled right on top!</p>
            <p>Although, technically, not a Filipino dish, its recipe strays
                from the original which exemplifies the countless other
                Filipino dishes that are influenced by other cultures.</p>
