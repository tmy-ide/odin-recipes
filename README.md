# odin-recipes

This is the first project that will be created for "The Odin Project" 
which will test our knowledge of the basics of HTML as well as reinforce
everything we've learned thus far. We will be creating a basic recipe 
webpage as our project. 

We will also be implementing the use of Git in order to build the habit 
of using Git and becoming more comfortable with it.
